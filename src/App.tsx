          <p>
            I am currently a final year student at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/" className='orange'>Imperial College London</a>. 
            I have a keen interest in Software Engineering, with experience using:

          <ul className='orange'>
            <li>C#</li>
            <li>Typescript</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>MATLAB</li>
            <li>R</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            I have gained this experience either professionally through internship experience and/or personal projects. I have a keen interest in financial technology, 
            particularly related to trading, as I have interned as a software engineer at a trading firm this past summer.

          <p>In my free time, I enjoy fashion, going to the gym, wood carving and watching cat videos! üê± </p>
